# ODI Topology Concepts

## Overview
- ODI topology represents information systems within ODI
- Consists of servers containing source data and target systems
- Used to connect resources in the information system for integration processes

## Components of Topology

### Physical Architecture
- Physical location of data (source and target)
- Supports various technologies (RDBMSes, files, big data)
- Includes data types and data servers
- Defines physical agents (Java runtime programs)

### Logical Architecture
- Used at design time for creating mappings
- Includes technologies and logical agents

### Contexts
- Map logical to physical architecture

### Other Components
- Languages (SQL, Jython, etc.)
- Repository information
- Actions (DDL commands)

## Data Servers and Physical Schemas

### Data Servers
- Systems capable of storing and providing data in table form
- Always attached to a specific technology
- Examples: Oracle instance, SQL Server instance, file servers

### Physical Schemas
- Technology-dependent subdivision of data servers
- Consists of data schema (actual data stores) and work schema (temporary objects)
- Technology-specific naming conventions

## Guidelines and Recommendations
1. Define each physical data server once in the topology
2. Define a physical schema for each subdivision of the server used in ODI
3. Define all schemas in the same database instance under the same data server
4. Ensure all data servers have a default schema

## Logical Schemas and Contexts
- Logical schemas are aliases for similar physical schemas
- Contexts map logical schemas to physical schemas at runtime
- One logical schema can represent multiple physical schemas across different environments

## Example Scenario
- Production sites in Boston and Tokyo with different configurations
- Development site in New York
- Same applications but different implementations
- Use of contexts to map logical schemas to appropriate physical schemas in each location

## Key Concepts
- Instances determine the number of data servers, not physical boxes
- Logical schemas allow design without worrying about physical storage
- Contexts enable runtime flexibility in choosing execution environment

# ODI Topology Part 2: Agents

## Agent Overview
- Lightweight Java runtime components
- Coordinate execution of integration processes
- Can be installed on any machine

## Types of Agents
1. Standalone Agent
2. Colocated Standalone Agent
3. Java EE Agent (recommended for production)

## Creating an Agent
1. Use Configuration Wizard
2. Set up domain and choose agent type
3. Configure connection details
4. Set up JDBC components
5. Install and configure the agent

## Registering Agent in ODI Studio
1. Create new physical agent in Topology tab
2. Name must match the one created by Configuration Wizard
3. Set machine and port details
4. Save the agent configuration

## Starting the Agent
- Navigate to agent location
- Use start script (shell or batch file)
- Verify connection in ODI Studio

## Agent Parameters
- Stored in ODI params file
- Include connection details, JDBC driver, username, password

## Load Balancing
- Can be configured for multiple agents
- Set up in Load Balancing tab

## Best Practices
1. One physical agent per started agent in ODI
2. In development, mimic most fragmented production environment
3. Plan topology by identifying all data servers and physical schemas
4. Use contexts to map logical to physical resources

## Quiz Questions
1. Number of physical schemas needed for one subdivision: 1
2. Number of physical resources a logical resource can map to in a context: 1
3. Number of contexts a physical schema can be used in: Any number
